# Leetcode Problem Solving Fun

This is just me having some fun attempting to come up with solutions to Leetcode problems.

## Quick Leetcode Rant

I'm honestly against the entire idea of using random Leetcode problems when attempting to hire candidates as it does not truly provide insight on a developers ability to handle day to day real life problems.

If anything, a general compiled list of questions related to the actual role a candidate is applying for should be used within Leetcode. By doing so you can easily gather true information about how a candidate thinks through problem solving.
